                <h2>FATHERS AND FAMILIES</h2>
                <p>Being a father is not easy; however, it is the single most important job in the lives of men who have children. The challenges of being a responsible father sometimes seem too difficult and there's no place to turn for help. If you, or someone you know, needs help to better provide for your children and yourself, a fatherhood program can help.</p>

            <div class="main_content clearfix">

                <h3>Dads make a difference.</h3>
                <div>

                </div>
                <p>Society has slowly acknowledged fathers' unique, vital contributions to child development. An infant only eight weeks old can tell whether a male or female is interacting with them. This diversity alone gives children a broader, richer experience than children raised by one gender.We provide guidance to help fathers fulfill their roles and enrich their lives as well as their childrens lives.</p>
                <h3>All about child support.</h3>
                
                <p>Fathers are always encouraged to pay something toward their child support commitment to show a good faith effort even when they can not pay all that is owed. However, fathers who can not pay their child support orders in full are encouraged to immediately take steps to address their payment shortfall with Child Support Enforcement or Family Court before they fall too far behind.</p>

                <h3>Understanding the benefits of marriage.</h3>
                <p>Is saying  "I do" right for you? Sure, marriage can change things. And it has to be a choice that's right for you. You may not have given much thought to marriage and there's a lot you may not know. But, before you make up your mind, take some time to learn the facts and see how marriage can be a good thing for you and your family</p>
